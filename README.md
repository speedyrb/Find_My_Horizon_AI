# Find_My_Horizon_AI
Building AI course project


## Summary
A proposal for an AI tool to assist in finding a self-help technique based on the user's likes, dislikes, and personal wellness goals. This AI will be supplied with many different methodologies that have been proven to be helpful to some, with no bias towards one or another. The user will answer questions and this will be used to suggest techniques and to deteremine those which may be the most helpful. This AI tool seeks to match a user with an established technique, not to serve as a therapeutic or friendly companion to directly improve the user's emotional state.


## Background
From my own perspective, I have tried many different self-help techniques through the years, and have found that some may be helpful for others, but they did not resonate with me. Similarly, the approaches that have helped me are not always helpful to others. This AI tool will solve this problem by suggesting an appropriate technique that matches the needs and preferences of the user.


## How is it used?
The Find My Horizon AI Tool will havee three main modes of operation:
* "Let's Talk" - The AI tool will ask questions to establish the baseline emotional state of the user, as well as to ascertain the user's preferences and tolerances of different self-help approaches
* "Try This" - Based on the answers to the above questions, a self-help technique will be suggested, and the user will be guided through it, step-by-step
* "Check-in" - The AI tool will ask questions to ascertain the user's current emotional state, comparing it to their initial emotional state, to help rate the current self-help technique's effectiveness, and possibly suggest a new technique


## Data sources and AI methods
There will be three data sets:
* Many of the most popular self-help techniques will be analyzed and broken down into their basic parts: how they function, what is required of the user, how they supposedly help, etc.
* Different possible emotional states will be described. This will be a second data set.
* Different user sentiments towards the characteristics of the self help techniques (the first data set) will be listed as a third data set.

These data sets will be populated via research.

## Challenges
There will be significant disclaimers presented to the user when interacting with this AI tool. This tool is meant to be helpful, but it may be beyond the scope of the help needed for the user. The user will be reminded that this is for light assistance with their emotional state only, and that it is better to work with a professional.

The main challenge will be in populating the data sets. The more accurate and complete the data sets, the better the matching of the self-help technique to the user will be.


## What next?
Assistance from self-help experts would make the population of the data sets more robust, leading to a more effective AI tool.


## Acknowledgments
Using chatbots to assist with emotional states is not new, so that is being recognized here. However, this AI tool seeks to match a user with an established technique, not to serve as a therapeutic or friendly companion to directly improve the user's emotional state.
