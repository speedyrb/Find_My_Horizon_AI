# Find_My_Horizon_AI
Building AI course project


## Summary
A proposal for an AI tool to assist in finding a self-help technique based on the user's likes, dislikes, and personal wellness goals. This AI will be supplied with many different methodologies that have been proven to be helpful to some, with no bias towards one or another. The user will answer questions and this will be used to suggest techniques and to deteremine those which may be the most helpful.


## Background
From my own perspective, I have tried many different self-help techniques through the years, and have found that some may be helpful for others, but they did not resonate with me. Similarly, the approaches that have helped me are not always helpful to others. This AI tool will solve this problem by suggesting an appropriate technique that matches the needs and preferences of the user.


## How is it used?
The Find My Horizon AI Tool will havee three main modes of operation:
* 1. "Let's Talk" - The AI tool will ask questions to establish the baseline emotional state of the user, as well as to ascertain the user's preferences and tolerances of different self-help approaches
* 2. "Try This" - Based on the answers to the above questions, a self-help technique will be suggested, and the user will be guided through it, step-by-step
* 3. "Check-in" - The AI toll will ask questions to ascertain the user's current emotional state, comparing it to the initial emotional state, to help rate the current self-help technique's effectiveness, and possibly suggest a new technique


## Data sources and AI methods
The data will be sourced by creating a list of self-help techniques, listing their characteristics.
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
